                    <h3>Who am I?
<p></p>I'm Olu, I currently work as a technical support. Working as a technical support has helped me develop a little understanding of common software, hardware, and network problems. 
I have gained troubleshooting skills, which have enabled me to assist people with common technical challenges. 
I'm patient, love challenges that always empower me to learn more, and am always looking for ways to make processes smoother and more efficient for end-users and the IT team.</h3> 

                    <p> What does technology mean to me?</p>
<p>Technology empowers innovation and problem-solving. It empowers people and organizations to do more, network better, and improve their day-to-day lives. 
As someone who supports users, I see the importance of ensuring that technology is accessible, efficient, and works seamlessly. Sometimes, Technology evolves, and it continues to improve the way we interact with the world. both big and small. 
For me, I see everything we do today is empowered by technology, and we can't just do without it.</p>

                        <p>What do I hope to do with what I learn?</p>
                            </p> With the knowledge I gain from this web development cohort, I hope to expand my technical skill set and transition into a role where I can not only support users but also contribute directly to building and improving systems that make their work easier.
                            Due to the structured learning path that was created by the teachers and mentors, I strongly believe that at the end of this cohort, I will gain a lot of technical skills in web development and security, which will empower me to transition into my next security career so I can bridge the gap between technical support, security, and web development. 
                            My ultimate goal is to help design, secure, and maintain user-friendly platforms that optimize performance and enhance the overall experience for people and the organization I work for.</p>
